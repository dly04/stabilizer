/// Shared Internal ADC Support
///
/// # Description
/// This module provides an abstraction to share ownership of a single ADC peripheral with multiple
/// ADC channels attached to it.
///
/// The design of this module mimics that of [`shared-bus`].
///
/// First, the shared ADC is created with the use of a macro, which places the ADC peripheral into
/// a mutable, static (singleton) location. Then, individual channels are created by passing in the
/// associated ADC input pin to the [SharedAdc::create_channel()] function to generate an
/// [AdcChannel]. The [AdcChannel]'s ownership can then be moved to any required drivers.
///
/// ## Synchronization
/// If the multiple priorities utilize the ADC that results in resource pre-emption, pre-emption is
/// protected against through the use of an atomic bool. Attempting to utilize the ADC from a
/// higher priority level while it is in use at a lower level will result in a [AdcError::InUse].
